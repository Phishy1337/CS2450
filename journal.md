Subject: Git, C++, vim

    This is the first journal entry I'll be making for my Software Engineering class with Jeff Compas.  

    I'm glad that Git and Github are making more intuitive sense to me, before it seemed like I had to google how to add, delete,
    commit, push, pull, and in what order just to make simple additions to code, but now I am creating and cloning repositories 
    without google for personal projects and the like.  This really is a handy tool

    I just completed a bigger portion of my C++ image processing project, it's quite complicated and am certainly thankful that
    ai is there to help, especially with debugging.  For example. I wasn't adding a certain file from assignment 1 (the warmup 
    assignment) into the makefile for assignment 2.  This lead to a linker error, and I probably would've spent hours trying to
    figure that out if I hadn't asked AI.  The trick is to use it as a teacher, ChatGPT asked me, "are you sure you are linking all 
    the necessary files for this assignment?  Where is the getInteger function located?"  And that immedietly lead me to figure it
    out

    As far as Software Engineering class goes, nothing to major has happened yet.  I am certainly excited to learn the process
    behind writing good software, I've tried making side projects and had I learned the process beforehand I think they would've
    turned out a bit better.
