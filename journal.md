Subject: Git, C++, vim

    This is the first journal entry I'll be making for my Software Engineering class with Jeff Compas.  

    I'm glad that Git and Github are making more intuitive sense to me, before it seemed like I had to google how to add, delete,
    commit, push, pull, and in what order just to make simple additions to code, but now I am creating and cloning repositories 
    without google for personal projects and the like.  This really is a handy tool

    I just completed a bigger portion of my C++ image processing project, it's quite complicated and am certainly thankful that
    ai is there to help, especially with debugging.  For example. I wasn't adding a certain file from assignment 1 (the warmup 
    assignment) into the makefile for assignment 2.  This lead to a linker error, and I probably would've spent hours trying to
    figure that out if I hadn't asked AI.  The trick is to use it as a teacher, ChatGPT asked me, "are you sure you are linking all 
    the necessary files for this assignment?  Where is the getInteger function located?"  And that immedietly lead me to figure it
    out

    As far as Software Engineering class goes, nothing to major has happened yet.  I am certainly excited to learn the process
    behind writing good software, I've tried making side projects and had I learned the process beforehand I think they would've
    turned out a bit better.

Subject: Flask errors, algorithms, math

    I gave myself proof of how useless AI can be sometimes with our beginning Flask assignment.  I spent an hour working with ChatGPT, checking my ipv4 address, changing the name of my local host, changing startup settings - all of this to realize I had a syntax error in the app.run line.  I cannot believe chat missed something that small, but I feel rewarded that I found it myself after some investigation!

    I am working on learning 6 different sorting algorithms currently; bubble, shaker, counting, quick, modified quick, and merge.  I've learned the first 3 quite well and can recreate them quickly from memory, but am struggling to remember certain aspects of quick and merge, usually off by 1 errors.  The plan is to crack a redbull and grind both from scratch with no help from google, which may take lots of trial and error but I believe will really strengthen my understanding.

    I used to hate math.  Since coming to college for Computer Science, I've started to realize it's utility and how cool it can be.  In discrete math, we're solving problems that feel very real and useful for real life, like counting, combinations, etc.  My friend made a joke saying we need to figure out ever single combination of subway sandwich possible, and it's funny that I could mathematically do that now.

Subject: Clean code and codex AI

    I am studying hard for a C++ test I have coming up, the biggest change I've made to the main branch is the makefile, as I kept having linker issues.  It's obvious now, but cleaning up my makefile code helped a lot with all my   errors.  I defined COMMON as all my common linked files, and throwing COMMON into the various makes makes it so much clearer, and I am spending far less time fixing linking issues

    AI is really incredible, and hard to resist!  I pay for ChatGPT, which gets me access to codex - a CLI based AI agent with context.  I spent a long time debugging an error for this class (CS2450), and after having codex check it took 1 prompt and 1 line response to fix it.  I feel like my debugging skills may deteriorate if I keep using ai for errors I can't find quickly, so I need to come up with a plan for when I should and shouldn't use AI.  Maybe ask where bugs might be to push me along the right path?

Subject: Many tests, Flow fun

    I have lots of tests this week - the one I am most worried about is Discrete Math.  Discrete math is a lot of fun, and it's pretty interesting to me, but it's hard!  I'll be studying lots in anticipation for that.

    Making the flow charts for the tools being used and for user direction was actually pretty fun, and I can see myself doing this for personal projects in the future.  Having a visual really does help keep things in scope and know what needs to be done and for why.

Subject: YouFace Presentations, Coding Fun, Vim adjustments

    My team and I just finished presenting our YouFace project, "RoommateHub".  I think the design of our slides could've used some work, but overall I am really happy with how everybody presented!  I really do like our idea and think it could be useful, even outside of just a class project

    This past Saturday, I spent a grand total of ~10 hours coding in C++ and and python and I'm starting to really enjoy coding, I'll finish an assignment and continue working out because I think I can improve it in some ways.  The goal now is to grow my passion and capacity for engineering, not just coding.  I want to be able to come up with a problem, and solve it in my own way rather than following instructions on assignments.  I think growing this skill will be far more useful in the job field, as well as in my personal life;  to be a good engineer I have to be a great programmer, so still working on developing that.

    On the topic of becoming a great developer, I've been using Vim for all of my coding as of late.  I saw a post showing that 40% of developers in all markets use Vim, so I feel it's something I should at least know my way aronud.  It's a lot of fun learning all the different shortcuts for splitting screens, deleting lines or words, replacing;  My favorite being ":vert term", which splits my edited file in half and shows a terminal I can use for testing while I code.  I've also downloaded YouCompleteMe, which is a LSP or Language Server Protocol for including autocomplete for various languages, most importantly the C languages and Python.
